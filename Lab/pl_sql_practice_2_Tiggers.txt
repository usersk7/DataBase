Trigger Example
-----------------
Assignment
------------


Create the following 3 tables and insert sample data as shown:-

 Ord_mst
 Ord_no Cust_cd Status
 1		C1		 P

 Ord_dtl
 Ord_no Prod_cd Qty
 1 		P1 		100
 1  	P2		200

 Prod_mst
 Prod_cd Prod_name Qty_in_stock Booked_qty
-----------------------------------------
 P1 Floppies 10000 1000
 P2 Printers 5000  600
 P3 Modems   3000  200

1. Write a Before Insert trigger on Ord_dtl. Anytime a row is inserted in Ord_dtl, the
Booked_qty in Prod_mst should be increased accordingly.

2. Write a Before Delete trigger on Ord_dtl. Anytime a row is deleted from Ord_dtl, the
Booked_qty in Prod_mst should be decreased accordingly.

3. Write a Before Update of Prod_cd, Qty trigger on Ord_dtl. Anytime the Prod_cd or
Qty is updated, the Booked_qty in Prod_mst should be increased/decreased
accordingly.

4. Write a Before Update of Status trigger on Ord_mst. If the Status is updated from P
(Pending) to D (Delivered), the Booked_qty and Qty_in_stock from Prod_mst should
be decreased accordingly. If the Status is updated from P (Pending) to C (Cancelled),
the details of the order should be deleted from Ord_dtl and corresponding Booked_qty
from Prod_mst should be decreased accordingly. (The Before delete trigger on Ord_dtl
would automatically decrease the Booked_qty from Prod_mst).
